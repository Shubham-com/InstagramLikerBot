Selenium is basically used to control all the actions in browser like automations in web browser,testing
to know that all buttons works or not.Suppose if you want to like all the post in instagram,accepts all the
connections in linkedin,these are repeated actions in browser and we need selenium.

for that we need a API,where we hit API Script it and our browser responds to it.(means go and scroll,like
or in buttons actions performed)
